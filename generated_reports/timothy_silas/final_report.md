## 1. Executive Summary

Timothy Silas Prugh Overturf is the founder, sole legal owner, and Chief Executive Officer of Sisu Capital, LLC, a now-defunct California-registered investment advisory firm that managed up to approximately $51.7 million in assets for roughly 42 high-net-worth clients. On August 1, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a federal civil complaint against Overturf, Sisu Capital, and his father, Hansueli "Hans" Overturf, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:23-cv-03855), alleging systematic violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 spanning from December 2017 through at least May 2021 — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). The SEC's core allegations include unauthorized and unsuitable trading in client accounts, deliberate deception of clients, the covert use of client funds to accumulate a thinly-traded bank stock for Overturf's personal business agenda, and the knowing employment of a twice-suspended investment adviser (his father) to manage client assets — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). Sisu Capital generated over $2 million in advisory fees and other compensation during the alleged misconduct period, and Overturf personally extracted approximately $858,000 in owner draws and loans from the firm between 2017 and 2019 — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The overall risk profile of this subject is assessed as **CRITICAL**, with active federal litigation, multiple confirmed regulatory violations, and significant unresolved financial exposure.

### 2.2 Biographical Background

Timothy Overturf is a resident of Arcata, California, as confirmed by the SEC's official litigation release — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). According to the official SEC complaint, Overturf founded Sisu Capital, LLC in October 2013 at approximately 18 years of age — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). This founding age implies a birth year of approximately 1994–1995, though this has not been independently verified through a primary biographical source.

His full legal name, Timothy Silas Prugh Overturf, is confirmed by two independent official SEC sources: the SEC AdviserInfo database and a 2014 Form ADV filing — [SEC AdviserInfo](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/individual/summary/6422933); [Form ADV Filing](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/169444/PDF/169444.pdf).

**Unverified biographical claims** (sourced from LinkedIn, a single non-authoritative platform, and therefore not confirmed):
- Overturf reportedly speaks English, German, and Swiss German at native or bilingual proficiency.
- He reportedly has an education entry for "itsMove" from 2010 to 2012.
- He reportedly met with TNO, a research organization in The Hague, Netherlands, to discuss token sales and initial coin offerings.

These claims are noted for completeness but should not be treated as confirmed facts absent independent corroboration.

### 2.3 Family Network

Overturf's father, Hansueli "Hans" Overturf (CRD# 4138916), is a central figure in the SEC enforcement action and is a co-defendant in the federal complaint. Hans Overturf was twice suspended by the State of California from association with any investment adviser: first from November 2011 to November 2014, and again from December 2017 to December 2019 — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). Despite these suspensions, the SEC alleges that Timothy Overturf knowingly allowed his father to provide investment advice to Sisu Capital clients and to execute trades using a limited power of attorney — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807).

**Unverified claim:** Hans Overturf reportedly now resides in Switzerland. This claim originates from a single news source and has not been confirmed by an authoritative record.

**Unverified claim:** Hans Overturf was reportedly accused in 2004 of defrauding an elderly couple with dementia out of $730,000 by convincing them to invest in a resort called Redwood Parks Lodge that was never built; he reportedly settled the matter by paying $420,000 after charges were dropped. This claim appears in news reporting but has not been confirmed against primary legal records within the scope of this investigation.

### 3.1 Career Timeline

| Period | Role | Organization | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| October 2013 | Founder | Sisu Capital, LLC | — | Founded at age ~18; [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) |
| October 2014 | Managing Member & Chief Compliance Officer | Sisu Capital, LLC | — | Per Form ADV filing; [Form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/169444/PDF/169444.pdf) |
| November 2014 – December 2020 | Registered Investment Adviser Representative | Sisu Capital, LLC | Mill Valley, CA | Per SEC complaint; [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) |
| 2016–2018; 2021 | Chief Compliance Officer | Sisu Capital, LLC | Mill Valley, CA | Per SEC complaint (note: contradicted by 2014 Form ADV showing earlier CCO role) |
| 2021 | Firm Shutdown | Sisu Capital, LLC | — | Registration revoked January 2021; [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) |

> **Note on CCO dates:** The SEC complaint states Overturf served as CCO from 2016 to 2018 and in 2021. However, the contemporaneous 2014 Form ADV filing lists him as CCO as of October 2014. The Form ADV is considered more authoritative for the 2014 period. This discrepancy has not been resolved and is flagged as an information gap.

| **Post-Revocation Operations** | Continued advising clients after January 2021 revocation | [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) |

Sisu Capital was registered as an investment adviser with the State of California for less than six years before shutting down in 2021 — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/); [MDF Law](https://mdf-law.com/timothy-overturf/). When Timothy Overturf founded the firm, his father Hans turned over many of his personal investment advisory clients to Sisu Capital — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). This client transfer is a significant structural element of the alleged scheme, as it established the initial client base that would later be subject to the alleged misconduct.

### 3.3 Other Affiliations

**Sisu Holding Company, Inc.:** A separate entity associated with the Sisu enterprise. Hans Overturf used a signature block identifying himself as "Head of Business Development, Sisu Holding Company, Inc." in communications with clients — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The precise legal relationship between Sisu Holding Company, Inc. and Sisu Capital, LLC has not been publicly disclosed and represents a material information gap.

**Arcata Theatre Lounge:** **(Unverified — single source, low confidence: 0.3)** According to a single news report, Timothy Overturf and a business partner named Joseph Ostini purchased the Arcata Theatre Lounge in 2019 — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). This claim has not been confirmed against property records, business filings, or any other independent source. It is noted here because, if true, the timing of this acquisition (during the alleged fraud period and coinciding with the $858,000 in owner draws) raises questions about the source of acquisition funds.

**John Figueiredo:** **(Unverified — single source)** A single news report identifies John Figueiredo as a cofounder and former CEO of both Sisu Capital and a separate entity called Sisu Extracts, and states he was a registered financial adviser with Sisu Capital from 2015 to 2016 while working as a software engineer in San Francisco — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). This claim has not been confirmed against SEC or FINRA registration records.

### 3.4 Professional Credentials

Overturf holds one confirmed industry examination: the Series 65 (Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination), verified against the official SEC AdviserInfo database — [SEC AdviserInfo](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/individual/summary/6422933); [MDF Law](https://mdf-law.com/timothy-overturf/). No other professional certifications, degrees, or credentials have been confirmed through authoritative sources.

## 4. Financial Connections & Fund Analysis

### 4.1 Assets Under Management

At its peak, Sisu Capital offered investment advisory and portfolio management services to approximately 42 high-net-worth clients and reported assets under management of up to approximately $51.7 million — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). These figures are drawn from the official SEC complaint and are considered highly reliable.

### 4.2 Fee Structure

Sisu Capital charged clients an annual fee equal to 2% of assets under management plus a 20% performance fee — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). This fee structure — combining a management fee with a performance fee — is characteristic of hedge fund-style arrangements and is notably aggressive for a small registered investment adviser managing retail high-net-worth clients.

### 4.3 Revenue and Personal Extraction

Sisu Capital generated over $2 million in advisory fees and other compensation through the alleged misconduct period — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). Of this, Timothy Overturf personally received approximately $858,000 in owner draws and loans from Sisu Capital between 2017 and 2019 alone — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, suggesting these funds may be characterized as proceeds of fraud — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf).

### 4.4 Investment Strategies and Alleged Misuse

The SEC complaint details two specific categories of alleged investment misconduct:

**1. Thinly-Traded Bank Stock Accumulation Scheme:**
The SEC alleges that Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf invested client funds in a thinly-traded bank stock contrary to client instructions, as part of an undisclosed plan to amass enough shares among Sisu Capital's clients and Overturf himself to propose business partnership ideas to the bank — including leveraging the bank's charter to accept crypto assets and to offer bank customers Sisu's advisory services — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). This constitutes a textbook undisclosed conflict of interest and potential market manipulation of a thinly-traded security.

**2. Unsuitable Complex Financial Instruments:**
Hans Overturf recommended, and Sisu Capital purchased on clients' behalf, an "inverse short-term volatility futures product" — a complex instrument designed for short-term use — which was held for months or over a year, far exceeding its intended holding period — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). Such products are well-documented to decay rapidly in value when held beyond their intended short-term window, making their long-term deployment in client accounts categorically unsuitable.

**Unverified claim:** A single news report states that in 2018, the broker-dealer that held Sisu clients' funds terminated its relationship with Sisu Capital — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). If accurate, this would represent a significant red flag that preceded the SEC's eventual enforcement action by five years. This claim has not been confirmed against broker-dealer records or the SEC complaint.

## 5. Risk Assessment

Risk flags are organized by category and rated by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) and confidence (0.0–1.0).

---

### 5.1 Legal Risk

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | SEC Federal Civil Complaint (August 2023) | Confidence: 0.9

On August 1, 2023, the SEC filed a federal civil complaint against Sisu Capital, LLC, Timothy Overturf, and Hansueli "Hans" Overturf in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:23-cv-03855) — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Court Docket via CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67656798/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-sisu-capital-llc/). The complaint charges Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the antifraud provisions), and charges Hans Overturf with aiding and abetting those violations — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). The case remains pending.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Unauthorized and Unsuitable Trading Over Multi-Year Period (2017–2021) | Confidence: 0.85

The SEC alleges that from December 2017 through at least May 2021, Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf breached their fiduciary duties by making unauthorized and unsuitable trades in client accounts, lying to clients, and allowing a suspended adviser to manage client assets — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [MDF Law](https://mdf-law.com/timothy-overturf/); [KlaymanToskes](https://klaymantoskes.com/broker-investigation/advisor-timothy-overturf). The multi-year duration of the alleged misconduct suggests systematic rather than isolated wrongdoing.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Post-Revocation Advisory Operations | Confidence: 0.9

The SEC complaint explicitly states that Sisu Capital continued advising clients after its registration was revoked by the State of California in January 2021 — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). Operating as an unregistered investment adviser is a distinct violation of the Investment Advisers Act, separate from and in addition to the fraud charges. Both the California and Ohio state registrations had lapsed by the time operations ceased.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Self-Dealing via Thinly-Traded Bank Stock | Confidence: 0.9

The SEC alleges that Overturf directed client funds into a thinly-traded bank stock contrary to client instructions, for the undisclosed purpose of accumulating a controlling position to advance his own business agenda — including proposals to leverage the bank's charter for cryptocurrency deposits and to cross-sell Sisu's advisory services — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). This represents a direct and undisclosed conflict of interest, a breach of fiduciary duty, and potential market manipulation of a thinly-traded security.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Knowing Employment of Twice-Suspended Adviser | Confidence: 0.9

The SEC alleges that from 2017 through 2021, Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf allowed Hans Overturf — who was suspended by the State of California from investment advisory activities from December 2017 to December 2019 — to provide investment advice to Sisu clients and to execute trades using a limited power of attorney — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). Timothy Overturf's awareness of his father's suspension status is a central element of the SEC's scienter argument.

#### 🟠 HIGH | Unsuitable Complex Financial Instruments | Confidence: 0.9

Hans Overturf recommended, and Sisu Capital purchased, inverse short-term volatility futures products designed for short-term use but held for months or over a year in client accounts — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The long-term holding of such instruments in client portfolios is categorically unsuitable and represents a specific pattern of sophisticated product misuse.

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Potential Unregistered Advisory Activity (2013–2014) | Confidence: 0.65

Sisu Capital was reportedly founded in October 2013, but Timothy Overturf did not register as an investment adviser representative until November 2014 — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [MDF Law](https://mdf-law.com/timothy-overturf/). This approximately one-year gap raises the question of whether advisory services were provided to clients before proper registration was obtained. This potential violation has not been explicitly addressed in the available SEC complaint materials.

---

### 5.2 Financial Risk

#### 🟠 HIGH | Personal Extraction of ~$858,000 During Alleged Fraud Period | Confidence: 0.9

Between 2017 and 2019 — the heart of the alleged fraud period — Timothy Overturf extracted approximately $858,000 from Sisu Capital in the form of owner draws and loans — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The SEC's pursuit of disgorgement suggests these funds may be characterized as proceeds of fraud, creating substantial personal financial liability for Overturf.

#### 🟠 HIGH | Firm Generated Over $2 Million in Fees During Alleged Misconduct | Confidence: 0.9

Sisu Capital generated over $2 million in advisory fees and other compensation during the alleged misconduct period — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). The SEC's disgorgement claim encompasses this entire amount, plus prejudgment interest, representing a potentially firm-ending financial liability.

#### 🟠 HIGH | Potential Commingling of Client Funds for Personal Acquisitions | Confidence: 0.3 (unverified)

**(Unverified — low confidence)** A single news report states that Overturf and a business partner purchased the Arcata Theatre Lounge in 2019 — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). If confirmed, the timing of this acquisition (concurrent with the $858,000 in draws from Sisu Capital) raises questions about the source of acquisition funds. This claim requires independent verification before any conclusion can be drawn.

---

### 5.3 Reputational Risk

#### 🟠 HIGH | Multiple Plaintiff Law Firms Actively Soliciting Harmed Investors | Confidence: 0.8

At least two national investment loss law firms — KlaymanToskes and MDF Law — have published public-facing investigation pages actively soliciting harmed Sisu Capital investors — [KlaymanToskes](https://klaymantoskes.com/broker-investigation/advisor-timothy-overturf); [MDF Law](https://mdf-law.com/timothy-overturf/). Active solicitation by multiple plaintiff firms signals substantial and widespread investor harm and indicates that civil litigation beyond the SEC action is likely forthcoming or already in progress.

#### 🟠 HIGH | Prominent Regional Media Coverage | Confidence: 0.9

The SEC enforcement action received prominent coverage in the Lost Coast Outpost, a regional news outlet serving the Humboldt County, California area where Overturf resides — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). This coverage has materially damaged Overturf's local reputation and has made the allegations accessible to his community and potential future business partners.

---

### 5.4 Behavioral Risk

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Dual Role as CEO and Chief Compliance Officer — Structural Self-Oversight | Confidence: 0.9

Timothy Overturf served simultaneously as CEO (and sole owner) and Chief Compliance Officer of Sisu Capital — [Form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/169444/PDF/169444.pdf); [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). This structural arrangement eliminated any independent compliance oversight, creating conditions in which the person responsible for detecting and preventing misconduct was the same person allegedly committing it. This is a fundamental governance failure that enabled the alleged multi-year fraud.

#### 🟠 HIGH | Firm Shutdown Potentially Timed to Evade Accountability | Confidence: 0.75

Sisu Capital's registration was revoked in January 2021 and the firm shut down that year — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). The firm closed during the alleged fraud period and approximately two years before the SEC filed its complaint. Shutting down a registered investment adviser can complicate regulatory enforcement, asset recovery, and client restitution. Whether the closure was voluntary, regulatory, or client-driven has not been confirmed.

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Extremely Limited Professional Experience at Time of Founding | Confidence: 0.85

Overturf founded Sisu Capital at approximately 18 years of age and his entire investment advisory career was confined to a firm he owned and controlled — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). He held only a Series 65 license and no other confirmed professional credentials — [SEC AdviserInfo](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/individual/summary/6422933). The absence of external employment history, mentorship, or independent oversight may have been a contributing factor to the alleged misconduct.

---

### 5.5 Network Risk

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Family-Based Co-Fraud Network | Confidence: 0.85

The SEC enforcement action names both Timothy Overturf and his father Hans Overturf as defendants, with Hans charged as an aider and abettor — [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807). Hans transferred his personal client base to Sisu Capital at founding, provided investment advice while suspended, and executed trades using a limited power of attorney — [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf). The family structure of the alleged scheme created a concentrated, potentially collusive environment with no independent check on either party's conduct.

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Opaque Corporate Structure: Sisu Holding Company, Inc. | Confidence: 0.7

Hans Overturf used a signature block identifying himself as "Head of Business Development, Sisu Holding Company, Inc." in client communications — [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/). This entity appears distinct from the registered investment adviser Sisu Capital, LLC, and its legal relationship to Sisu Capital has not been publicly disclosed. The use of a holding company alongside a registered investment adviser can obscure fund flows and liability structures.
