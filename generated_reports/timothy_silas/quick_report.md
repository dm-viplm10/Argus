## 1. Executive Summary

Timothy Overturf, the CEO and owner of Sisu Capital, LLC, is the subject of a significant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action filed on August 1, 2023, alleging serious breaches of fiduciary duty to clients over a multi-year period. The SEC charges Overturf and Sisu Capital with making unauthorized and unsuitable trades on behalf of approximately 42 high-net-worth clients from December 2017 through at least May 2021, during which time the firm generated over $2 million in advisory fees and compensation from the alleged misconduct. A central element of the case involves Overturf knowingly permitting his father, Hansueli "Hans" Overturf — a twice-suspended California investment advisor — to advise clients and execute trades on their behalf without disclosure, in direct violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Sisu Capital ceased operations in 2021, and the SEC is seeking injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. The overall risk profile for Timothy Overturf is assessed as **CRITICAL**, with multiple high-confidence legal and financial risk flags supported by official regulatory sources.

### Biographical Overview

Timothy Overturf is a California-based investment professional who founded Sisu Capital, LLC, a wealth management firm headquartered in Arcata, California. The precise founding year is disputed: one source places it at 2013, when Overturf would have been approximately 18 years old, while another source records the founding year as 2014 — a discrepancy that has not been independently resolved from available open sources ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/); [Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA)).

Overturf's LinkedIn profile indicates proficiency in English, German, and Swiss German, which may reflect a familial connection to Switzerland — consistent with his father Hans Overturf's reported location in Switzerland ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-overturf-9aa63378)). These biographical details are self-reported and have not been independently corroborated by the sources reviewed for this report.

Sisu Capital, LLC operated as a registered investment advisory firm offering portfolio management and advisory services to high-net-worth clients ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/657600Z:US); [Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). Timothy Overturf served as CEO and ran the firm's day-to-day administrative and trading operations ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-overturf-9aa63378); [SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807)).

The firm ceased operations in 2021, coinciding with the tail end of the period covered by the SEC's allegations ([Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

### 3.2 Sisu Holding Company, Inc.

A related entity, Sisu Holding Company, Inc., is referenced in connection with Hans Overturf's role as "Trader, Head of Business Development" ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). The precise relationship between Sisu Holding Company, Inc. and Sisu Capital, LLC — including ownership structure, operational overlap, and current status — has not been fully established from available open sources and warrants further investigation.

### 3.3 Arcata Theatre Lounge

> ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED CLAIM:** According to a report by the Lost Coast Outpost, Timothy Overturf purchased the Arcata Theatre Lounge in 2019 with a business partner named Joseph Ostini. This claim has not been independently corroborated by additional sources reviewed for this report and should be treated as unverified pending further investigation ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

### 3.4 Series 65 Certification

Overturf's LinkedIn profile lists a Series 65 (Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination) certification issued by FINRA ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-overturf-9aa63378)). This credential has not been independently verified through FINRA's BrokerCheck or state regulatory databases within the scope of this investigation. Given the pending SEC enforcement action, verification of current licensure status is strongly recommended.

## 4. Financial Connections & Fund Analysis

### 4.1 Assets Under Management

At its peak, Sisu Capital reported assets under management of approximately **$51.7 million**, serving a client base of approximately **42 high-net-worth individuals** ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). These figures are drawn from the SEC complaint and are considered highly credible.

### 4.2 Fee Structure

> ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED CLAIM:** The Lost Coast Outpost reports that Sisu Capital charged clients an annual fee equal to two percent (2%) of assets under management, plus a twenty percent (20%) performance fee. This fee structure has not been independently corroborated by a second source reviewed for this report ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

### 4.3 Alleged Misconduct-Derived Revenue

The SEC alleges that through unauthorized and unsuitable trading activity conducted from December 2017 through at least May 2021, Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf generated **over $2 million** in advisory fees and other compensation ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). The SEC is seeking disgorgement of these ill-gotten gains as part of its enforcement action.

### 4.4 Personal Financial Extractions

> ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED CLAIM:** The Lost Coast Outpost reports that from 2017 to 2019, Timothy Overturf took home approximately **$858,000** in owner draws and loans from Sisu Capital. This figure has not been independently corroborated by a second source reviewed for this report ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

### 4.5 Alleged Trading Misconduct — Key Details

The following claims are drawn from a single news source reporting on the contents of the SEC complaint. While the sourcing is credible (direct reporting on an official filing), these specific details have not been independently corroborated and are therefore classified as **unverified**:

> ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED CLAIMS (from SEC complaint as reported by Lost Coast Outpost):**
> - In 2018, the broker-dealer holding Sisu clients' funds terminated its relationship with Sisu Capital.
> - Hans Overturf allegedly made misleading statements to clients about the broker-dealer split, characterizing the move as being for "flexibility and lower fees."
> - Hans Overturf allegedly convinced clients to grant him access to successor brokerage accounts, after which he and Timothy made trades contrary to client instructions.
> - In October 2019 and March 2021, Timothy Overturf allegedly purchased thinly-traded stock of a particular bank for five Sisu client accounts, contrary to client instructions.
> - Timothy Overturf allegedly purchased 2,300 additional shares of a bank's stock between March 2020 and March 2021 for a client who had specifically instructed Hans Overturf to sell those holdings.
> - The SEC alleges Timothy and Hans Overturf had a secret plan to amass enough shares in a bank to propose partnership ideas, including leveraging the bank's charter to accept crypto assets.
> - Hans Overturf allegedly recommended and purchased unsuitable, complex financial instruments — including an "inverse short-term volatility futures product" — for Sisu clients.

## 5. Risk Assessment

Risk flags are organized by category and rated by severity and confidence level.

**Severity Scale:** 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low
**Confidence Scale:** 0.0 (Unverified) → 1.0 (Confirmed)

---

### 5.1 Legal Risks

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Confidence: 0.90 — SEC Charges: Breach of Fiduciary Duty & Unauthorized Trading

On August 1, 2023, the SEC filed charges against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC, alleging that they breached fiduciary duties owed to clients by making unauthorized and unsuitable trades from December 2017 through at least May 2021 ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). This represents the most serious risk flag in this report, as it is sourced directly from an official SEC litigation release.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Obtain and review the full SEC complaint and court docket for detailed allegations, current case status, and any interim orders or settlements.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Confidence: 0.90 — Permitting Suspended Advisor to Operate

The SEC alleges that Timothy Overturf knowingly allowed his father, Hans Overturf — who had been twice suspended by the State of California from acting as an investment advisor — to advise Sisu clients and make investment decisions on their behalf, without disclosing this to clients ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). This conduct, if proven, constitutes a fundamental violation of regulatory disclosure obligations and fiduciary duty.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Investigate all client accounts advised by Hans Overturf; review all client communications for disclosure failures.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL | Confidence: 0.90 — Alleged Violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940

The SEC alleges that Sisu Capital, Timothy Overturf, and Hans Overturf violated the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is seeking injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

**Recommended Follow-up:** Monitor court filings for updates on penalties, settlements, or additional enforcement actions. Assess potential for parallel criminal referral.

---

#### 🟠 HIGH | Confidence: 0.90 — Co-Defendant: Hans Overturf Charged with Aiding and Abetting

The SEC separately charged Hansueli "Hans" Overturf — Timothy's father — with aiding and abetting his son's and Sisu Capital's violations ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). The involvement of a family member with a documented history of regulatory sanctions significantly elevates the network risk profile.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Investigate Hans Overturf's full disciplinary history, current location (reported as Switzerland), and any ongoing involvement in financial services.

---

#### 🟠 HIGH | Confidence: 0.90 — Hans Overturf's Prior California Regulatory Suspensions

Hans Overturf was twice suspended by the State of California from acting as an investment advisor. He allegedly failed to inform Sisu clients of this disciplinary history ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/); [SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807)).

> ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED CLAIM:** The Lost Coast Outpost additionally reports that in 2004, Hans Overturf was accused of bilking an elderly couple with dementia out of $730,000, and subsequently agreed to pay the family $420,000 following the couple's deaths. These specific allegations have not been independently corroborated by a second source reviewed for this report.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Obtain California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) and FINRA BrokerCheck records for Hans Overturf's complete disciplinary history.

---

### 5.2 Financial Risks

#### 🟠 HIGH | Confidence: 0.90 — Over $2 Million in Alleged Misconduct-Derived Compensation

The SEC alleges that Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf generated over $2 million in advisory fees and other compensation through the alleged misconduct ([SEC LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)). The SEC's pursuit of disgorgement means Overturf faces potential liability for the full amount of these fees.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Analyze financial records for client harm quantification, fee structure anomalies, and potential restitution requirements.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Confidence: 0.60 — Firm Dissolution and Outstanding Liabilities

Sisu Capital ceased operations in 2021, raising concerns about the availability of assets for client restitution and the resolution of outstanding regulatory and civil liabilities ([Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA); [Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/)).

**Recommended Follow-up:** Confirm dissolution proceedings through California Secretary of State records; investigate the current status of client assets and any unresolved claims.

---

### 5.3 Reputational Risks

#### 🟠 HIGH — Pattern of Alleged Client Harm Across Multiple Dimensions

The allegations against Overturf encompass unauthorized trading, unsuitable investment recommendations, concealment of a co-advisor's regulatory disqualification, and potential self-dealing. Taken together, these allegations describe a systematic pattern of conduct that, if proven, would represent a fundamental betrayal of client trust across the firm's entire operational history.

---

### 5.4 Behavioral Risks

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Confidence: 0.40 — Conflicting Founding Year / Potential Credential Inflation

Sources conflict on the founding year of Sisu Capital: one source reports 2013 (when Overturf would have been approximately 18 years old), while another records 2014 ([Lost Coast Outpost](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/aug/18/sec-accuses-timothy-overturf-owner-and-ceo-local-i/); [Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA)). While this discrepancy may reflect a data error, it warrants verification, particularly given the broader context of alleged misconduct.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Verify corporate formation documents through California Secretary of State records for the accurate founding date.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM | Confidence: 0.40 — Unverified Series 65 Certification

Overturf's Series 65 certification is self-reported on LinkedIn and has not been independently verified through FINRA BrokerCheck or state regulatory databases within the scope of this investigation ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-overturf-9aa63378)). Given the pending SEC enforcement action, verification of current licensure status is essential.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Check FINRA BrokerCheck and California DFPI databases for license verification, current status, and any disciplinary records.

---

### 5.5 Network Risks

#### 🟠 HIGH — Family-Based Operational Structure Enabling Regulatory Evasion

The operational structure of Sisu Capital — in which a formally disqualified individual (Hans Overturf) exercised de facto advisory and trading authority under the cover of his son's registered entity — represents a significant network risk pattern. This structure enabled the alleged circumvention of California regulatory sanctions and federal disclosure requirements, and may indicate a deliberate design to obscure the true decision-making authority within the firm.

### Key Relationship Observations

1. **Timothy–Hans Overturf Nexus:** The most operationally significant relationship in this network is the father-son dynamic between Timothy and Hans Overturf. Hans, despite being twice suspended by California regulators, allegedly functioned as a de facto investment advisor and trader within Sisu Capital — a role that Timothy allegedly facilitated and concealed from clients. This relationship is the central thread of the SEC's enforcement action.

2. **Sisu Capital / Sisu Holding Company Overlap:** The existence of a separate entity, Sisu Holding Company, Inc., in which Hans Overturf held a formal title, suggests a more complex corporate structure than a single LLC. The relationship between these entities requires further investigation.

3. **Geographic Dispersion:** Timothy Overturf is located in Mill Valley, California; Sisu Capital, LLC was headquartered in Arcata, California (approximately 280 miles north); and Hans Overturf is reported to be located in Switzerland. This geographic dispersion, combined with the alleged concealment of Hans's role, may have complicated client oversight and regulatory scrutiny.

4. **Joseph Ostini:** Referenced as a business partner in connection with the alleged purchase of the Arcata Theatre Lounge. The nature and extent of any financial relationship between Ostini and Overturf beyond this alleged transaction is unknown.
